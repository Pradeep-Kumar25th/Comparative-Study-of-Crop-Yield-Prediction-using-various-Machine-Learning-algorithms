# Comparative-Study-of-Crop-Yield-Prediction-using-various-Machine-Learning-algorithms
The research paper compares three popular regression techniques, namely Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, for predicting crop yields. The study uses historical crop yield data, weather patterns, and soil characteristics as inputs for model training and evaluation. Preprocessing methods like LabelEncoder and Fillna are used to handle missing data and convert categorical values into numeric values. The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics like RMSE, MSE, MAE, and R2.


The research finds that all three models can effectively predict crop yields, but with varying levels of accuracy and interpretability. Linear Regression offers simplicity and interpretability, while Decision Tree Regressor captures non-linear relationships. Random Forest Regressor combines ensemble learning to improve prediction accuracy. The paper also discusses the challenges associated with each model, such as overfitting and model complexity.


Additionally, the paper presents a proposed methodology that includes other regression techniques like Gradient Boosting Regressor and Support Vector Regression (SVR). A comparison table is provided, showing the performance of each algorithm in terms of R2 score, RMSE, and MAE. The DecisionTreeRegressor stands out as the top performer with high R2 score, low RMSE, and small MAE, followed closely by GradientBoostingRegressor.


Overall, the study provides insights into the strengths and limitations of different regression techniques for crop yield prediction, helping in agricultural planning and resource management.
